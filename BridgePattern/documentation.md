 This bridge pattern solves the problem of needing to create multiple classes for shape and color. For example if you had a triangle, and you wanted a red and a blue triangle, you would need to introduce two new subclasses, one for each color. Thus the class hierarchy would keep growing. But with bridge pattern, we are able to address that by decoupling the class into two different hierarchies
